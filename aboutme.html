                    <h3>My journey so far, My Successes and Struggles</h3>
                    <p>
                        I began to learn coding back in Jan 22 where i set my self a goal of learning something new as currently not enjoying my career as i have been in the UK civil service for just over 20years now. 
                        I started doing some fre courses FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. Although i loved FreeCodeCamp i wasn't feeling the same for The Odin Project. 
                        This is when i stumbled across the Scrimba podcast and decided to give the Scrimba platform ago and started the Front_end developer career path.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        If I look back since Jan 22, It's amazing what i have learnt considering i knew nothing about coding or HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
                        I feel i have learnt HTML an CSS pretty well but my current struggles is still Javascript. I feel i still don't have the confidence to build apps with JavaScript. 
                        I will continue learning and wont give up as i need a career change and really enjoying it and finding it interesting.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Goals 2023</h3>
                    <p>
                        My main goals are to get to grips with Javascript and really get to understand it so i am more confident. Learn some Javascript framewors as not learnt any of these yet.
                        My long term goal is to change careers and get into a job I love and enjoy.
                        This seems like it's far, far away but I am determined and motivated to get there.
                    </p>
