                    <h3 class="articles-titles">How I got started with scrimba</h3>
                    <p>
                        I found an interest in Front-End web development in Jan 22 and was already taking part in some free courses like FreeCodeCamo.org and The Odin Project. 
                        Although i loved FreeCodeCamp i didn't have the love for The Odin Project so much. I then started to listen to some podcasts and stubled across the Srimba podcast and loved it straight away. 
                        This prompted me to take an intreset and signup to the Front-end career path and currently on module 6 and am eally enjoying it so far.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    My plan is to continue with the career path and take as mny other courses as well to further my knowledge. 
                    I still feel i need more lessons on Javascript as really fnding this challenging

                        How I stay committed to learning
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I try to schedule in 2 hours a day to learn, weather this is actual coding, watching videos or reading, I make sure I am doing something and to be consistant each day.
                        I will continue to be consistant as I have learnt so much that didn't know and not worry to much how long it is taking me.
